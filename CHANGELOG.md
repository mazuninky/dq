# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `loc.pointer` rule field (jq expression returning a JSON Pointer string).
  When set, the lint evaluator looks up the pointer in the input document's
  provenance map and resolves the diagnostic's `(line, col)` from the
  parser-recorded byte span — no more `loc.line` int-coercion to recover
  positions for span-aware formats (YAML, JSON, TOML).
- `dq_core::Ir::line_col_for(&Pointer) -> Option<(u32, u32)>` for callers
  that need the `(line, col)` of a pointer's value through the IR.
- `dq_transform::ir_to_val` / `dq_transform::val_to_owned_ir` IR-aware
  variants of the value adapter (provenance is dropped on the way into jaq
  and reconstructed as `Provenance::Synthetic { Computed }` on the way out
  — see `data-query-transform` spec for the contract).
- `dq_core::Value::to_serde_json` and `dq_core::Value::from_serde_json`
  promoted from private duplicates in `dq-cli` and `dq-core::transform` to
  a single public API.

### Changed

- `dq_exec::Evaluator::evaluate_file` now takes `&dq_core::Ir<'_>` instead
  of `&serde_json::Value`. Internally the evaluator still feeds `serde`
  values into jaq; the `Ir` is required so the new `loc.pointer` chain has
  access to the provenance map.
- `dq lint` (and `dq check`) now route YAML and JSON inputs through the
  span-aware parsers, so `loc.pointer`-using rules emit accurate
  `(line, col)` instead of falling through to `(1, 1)`.
- `@std/k8s/image-pull-policy-always` migrated to `loc.pointer`; its
  `check.jq` now emits a pointer per violation that anchors at the
  offending container's `name:` scalar.

### Deprecated

- `loc.line` jq override. Backwards-compatible fallback when `loc.pointer`
  is unset or fails to resolve to a span. Removal is deferred to a future
  change once the `@std/*` rule library has fully migrated.
